# Air-Quality-Data-Analysis-Prediction-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard and data analysis project to monitor, visualize, and analyze Air Quality Index (AQI) trends across various cities using historical pollutant data.




# Air Quality Data Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data across various cities to understand pollution patterns and the impact of different pollutants. Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw environmental data into an interactive dashboard that provides insights into Air Quality Index (AQI) levels.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Pollutant Breakdown:** Detailed analysis of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizing AQI fluctuations over time (Monthly/Yearly).
- **City-wise Comparison:** A comparative study of pollution levels in different urban areas.
- **Data Insights:** Identifying the primary drivers of high pollution in specific regions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI:** Data Visualization & Dashboarding
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For custom measures and calculations
- **CSV/Excel:** Data source and cleaning

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains historical air quality readings, including various chemical concentrations and the overall AQI category (e.g., Good, Satisfactory, Poor, Severe).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the interactive filters to see city-specific or pollutant-specific data.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to handle and clean large environmental datasets.
- Creating meaningful visualizations that tell a story.
- Using DAX to create complex data relationships.
